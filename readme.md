## Introduction

Car Marketplace is a web application where users can browse, buy, and sell cars. This project is a learning exercise for me to get hands-on experience with TypeScript, ESLint, Next.js, and Docker.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
